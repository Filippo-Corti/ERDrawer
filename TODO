A. MODELING THE GRAPH LAYOUT:

☑ Count the number of crossings in the result
☑ Generate X Graphs and pick the one with the least amount of crossings to be shown
☐ Try to avoid the crossing, if possible, using a path finding algorithm
☐ Get to a point where the resulting graph looks like it could be a decent ER Diagram
☐ Build an import-export system

B. DRAW THE ER DIAGRAM

☐ Figure out what's a node and what's an edge
☐ Create an ER Diagram with only basic Entities and Relationships
